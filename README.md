# Data-Exploration-on-Unemployment-and-Mental-illness-Survey-
This is a data analyst project showing an exploratory analysis of the linkage between mental illness and unemployment from a dataset gotten from Kaggle using SQL. 


## Potential areas to investigate (explore) in the dataset:
* Linkage between unemployment and education level
* the number of female and male individuals that carried out the survey
* The effect of a gap on your resume on income level
* Symptom/side effects impact on employment
* The effectiveness of social welfare programs
* The linkage between gaps in your resume and hospitalizations due to mental illness
* the average annual income per region and the analogy with its percentage of unemployed citizens
* comparison between the average income each region rakes in annually to the percentage of unemployed citizens
